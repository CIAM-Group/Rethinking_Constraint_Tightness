We apply our proposed method to the classic POMO model to solve CVRPTW instances with varying degrees of time window constraint tightness.
We carry out the specific implementation based on the code of [MVMoE](https://github.com/RoyalSkye/Routing-MVMoE).
Thanks to the authors of MVMoE.


We modify the tightness degrees of time window in the function `def get_random_problems_2()` in `envs/VRPTWEnv.py`
